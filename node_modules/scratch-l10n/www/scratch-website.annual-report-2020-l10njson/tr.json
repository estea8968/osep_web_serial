    "annualReport.2020.foundersMessageP2": "Pandemi boyunca, dünyanın dört bir yanındaki, çoğu evlerinde izole olan genç insanlar, Scratch sitesine her zamankinden daha fazla sayıda geldi ve Scratch'i kendilerini yaratıcı bir şekilde ifade edebilecekleri, yeni beceriler öğrenebilecekleri ve birbirleriyle işbirliği yapabilecekleri güvenli bir alan olarak gördüler. 2020'de gençlerin oluşturduğu pek çok Scratch projesinden ilham aldık ve birçoğu pandemi, iklim değişikliği, ırksal adaletsizlik ve akıllarındaki diğer konular hakkındaki düşüncelerini ve duygularını paylaştı. Gençler sadece hesaplama kavramlarını ve becerilerini öğrenmekle kalmıyor, aynı zamanda seslerini ve kimliklerini de geliştiriyorlar.",
    "annualReport.2020.foundersMessageP3": "Scratch'in önümüzdeki yıllarda gençlerin hayatındaki bu önemli rolü oynamaya devam edebilmesi için Scratch'te önemli organizasyonel değişiklikler yapıyoruz. 2020'nin başında, Scratch Ekibi MIT Medya Laboratuvarı'ndaki uzun zamandır evinden çıkıp Scratch Vakfı'nın Boston şehir merkezindeki yeni ofislerine taşındı. Bu hamle, Scratch'i geleceğe yönelik küresel bir yaratıcı kodlama platformu olarak destekleyebilecek sürdürülebilir bir organizasyon oluşturmamıza yardımcı olacak.",

Duke ve MIT gibi kurumlardaki kariyeri boyunca Shawna, farklı topluluklardan öğrencilerin öğrenme deneyimlerini genişletmek için çalıştı. Bu birliktelik, Scratch'in misyonu ve değerleriyle güçlü bir şekilde uyumludur ve Scratch'teki liderliğinde önemli bir rol oynayacaktır. Shawna'nın bu yıllık raporun sonundaki mesajını okumanızı tavsiye ederim.",

Through our conversations with families and educators from around the world, we know that in 2020, kids from all communities needed creative learning opportunities to express their ideas and build their skills more than ever, even while many of them did not have the ability to go to school.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText3": "As the world adapted and approached creative learning and self expression in new ways, many educators, parents, and young people turned to Scratch. We saw 40% more Scratchers creating projects year over year, and Scratchers left 200% more comments in 2020 than in 2019. Young people from all around the world used Scratch as a place to connect, converse, collaborate, and engage with one another. We saw them discover the amazing things they could create when they were given the opportunity to think creatively and solve problems they were passionate about. ",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText4": "In the wake of the pandemic, some have called for a “return to normal.” But for many young people, the freedom to learn and explore was missing in our schools well before COVID-19.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessagePullQuote": "We must do everything we can to change the systemic inequities in our educational systems, because “normal” was not built to be fair and equitable for most of our children.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText5": "In 2021, Scratch is redoubling our efforts to reach young people who have been historically excluded from creative computing and other creative learning opportunities. With support from Google.org, we’ve launched the Scratch Education Collaborative (SEC), a powerful network of organizations across the world focused on supporting these learners in developing their confidence in creative computing. The 41 organizations in year one of the new program will connect with and learn from the Scratch Team and one another, and develop Equity Toolkits that will support them as they grow and scale their support for the learners in their community.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText6": "Our work to make Scratch even more equitable and inclusive is far from over. I’m excited to share more with you in the coming months. Until then, I’d like to extend my sincere appreciation to the Scratch Community for continuing to support and care for each other through a turbulent year. Your creativity and compassion never ceases to inspire us.",
