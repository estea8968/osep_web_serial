    "guidelines.header3": "Help keep Scratch a welcoming, supportive, and creative space for all by following these Community Guidelines:",
    "guidelines.respectheader": "Односи се према свима са поштовањем.",
    "guidelines.respectbody": "Scratchers have diverse backgrounds, interests, identities, and experiences. Everyone on Scratch is encouraged to share things that excite them and are important to them—we hope that you find ways to celebrate your own identity on Scratch, and allow others to do the same. It’s never OK to attack a person or group’s identity or to be unkind to someone about their background or interests.",
    "guidelines.privacyheader": "Be safe: keep personal and contact information private.",
    "guidelines.privacybody": "For safety reasons, don't give out any information that could be used for private communication, in person or online. This includes sharing real last names, phone numbers, addresses, hometowns, school names, email addresses, usernames or links to social media sites, video chatting applications, or websites with private chat functionality.",
    "guidelines.helpfulheader": "Дај корисне повратне информације.",
    "guidelines.helpfulbody": "Everyone on Scratch is learning. When commenting on a project, remember to say something you like about it, offer suggestions, and be kind, not critical.

    "guidelines.remixbody1": "Комбиновање је када градите на туђим пројектима, коду, идејама, сликама или било чему другом што деле на Скрачу, да бисте направили своју јединствену креацију.",
    "guidelines.remixbody2": "Remixing is a great way to collaborate and connect with other Scratchers. You are encouraged to use anything you find on Scratch in your own creations, as long as you provide credit to everyone whose work you used and make a meaningful change to it. And when you share something on Scratch, you are giving permission to all Scratchers to use your work in their creations, too.",
    "guidelines.honestyheader": "Буди искрен.",
    "guidelines.honestybody": "It’s important to be honest and authentic when interacting with others on Scratch, and remember that there is a person behind every Scratch account.

    "guidelines.friendlyheader": "Помози да сајт остане пријатељски.",
    "guidelines.friendlybody": "It’s important to keep your creations and conversations friendly and appropriate for all ages. If you think something on Scratch is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise disruptive to the community, click “Report” to let us know about it. Please use the “Report” button rather than engaging in fights, spreading rumors about other people’s behavior, or otherwise responding to any inappropriate content. The Scratch Team will look at your report and take the appropriate action."
