    "faq.biggerBlocksScratch3Body": "In order to make Scratch 3.0 work well on touch devices (like many Chromebooks, Windows Surface laptops, and tablets), we needed to make the blocks bigger, so that it’s easier to drag and tap the blocks. In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.",

    "faq.remixableBody": "We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.",
    "faq.creativeCommonsTitle": "Bagaimana jika saya tidak ingin orang lain untuk meremix karya-karya saya?",
    "faq.creativeCommonsBody": "Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.",

    "faq.createAccountTitle": "How can I create an account?",
    "faq.createAccountBody": "Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!",

Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.",

    "faq.newScratcherTitle": "Bagaiman cara agar saya pindah dari 'New Scratcher' menjadi 'Scratcher'?",
    "faq.newScratcherBody": "When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )",
    "faq.multipleAccountTitle": "Bolehkan saya punya lebih dari satu akun?",
    "faq.multipleAccountBody": "It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.",
    "faq.multipleLoginTitle": "Bolehkah lebih dari satu orang menggunakan satu akun?",
    "faq.multipleLoginBody": "This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.",
    "faq.changeUsernameTitle": "Bisakan saya mengubah username saya?",
    "faq.changeUsernameBody": "The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.",
    "faq.shareInfoTitle": "Informasi apa yang boleh saya bagikan menggunakan akun saya?",
    "faq.shareInfoBody": "Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website.

    "faq.sellProjectsTitle": "Bolehkan saya menjual karya-karya Scratch saya?",
    "faq.sellProjectsBody": "Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation.

    "faq.noFlameTitle": "Apa yang harus saya lakukan jika saya melihat seseorang berbuat jahat atau tidak menghargai?",
    "faq.noFlameBody": "Jangan bikin tambah panas! Membalas komentar-komentar jahat dengan komentar yang bernada sama hanya akan memperparah keadaan, dan dapat membuat akunmu diblokir. Melainkan, cukup laporkan apa saja yang tidak sopan ataupun membantu, dan kami akan mengikuti laporan tersebut. Kami mengecek laporan-laporan setiap hari, berkali-kali sehari - jadi jangan khawatir, kami akan membereskan semuanya.",
    "faq.reviewContentTitle": "Apa yang dilakukan Scratch Team saat sesuatu dilaporkan?",
    "faq.reviewContentBody": "The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account.

    "faq.blockedAccountTitle": "Apa yang terjadi saat suatu akun diblokir?",
    "faq.blockedAccountBody": "When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.",

    "faq.stolenAccountBody": "You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.",
    "faq.aboutExtensionsTitle": "Apa itu ekstensi?",
    "faq.aboutExtensionsBody": "In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ",
    "faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle": "How do I add an extension to a project?",
    "faq.howToAddExtensionsBody": "If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.",
    "faq.createExtensionsTitle": "How do I create my own extension for Scratch",
    "faq.createExtensionsBody": "The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future.

    "faq.newScratcherCloudBody": "If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables.

    "faq.multiplayerTitle": "Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?",
