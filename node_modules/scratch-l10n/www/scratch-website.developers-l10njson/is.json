    "developers.scratchBlocksIntro": "Scratch Blocks is a new development project for the next generation of graphical programming blocks, based on a collaboration between Google and MIT’s Scratch Team — building on Google’s {blocklyLink} and informed by the Scratch Team’s expertise in developing creative learning tools for young people. Scratch Blocks will provide a framework for building programming blocks in both vertical (text-based) and horizontal (icon-based) formats. You can access the code (currently as a developer-preview) and documentation {githubLink}.",
    "developers.scratchBlocksBody": "This first release includes code for Scratch’s Horizontal Grammar. Looking ahead, we plan to release additional code including but not limited to the Vertical Grammar (currently used by Scratch), a new Rendering Engine to support sprites and graphic effects, and a new Audio Engine to support creation with sound and music.",
